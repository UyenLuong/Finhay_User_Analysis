- The percentage of customers with total transaction values lower than the average is 85% of the total user base. 
=> We can create a leader board and provide additional benefits to users who achieve the average transaction value.

- Approximately 11% of customers have shown loyalty by conducting more than 10 transactions in the past 3 months. 
=> We should reward these loyal customers for their frequent transactions

- At the end of April and the beginning of May, there were more withdrawal transactions than deposit transactions in the "Chứng khoán" and "Tích luỹ" products.

- The reason behind this is that at the beginning of May, there is an extended holiday period, followed by the peak tourist season. People tend to withdraw money from the stock market or savings accounts to meet their personal needs during this time of increased travel demand
